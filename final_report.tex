% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
The automobile industry is constantly evolving with technology, 
one of the most important advancements is fuel efficiency. 
This is tied in with a combined effort to curb the use of fossil fuels and reduce the total amount of emissions. 
This study will examine the correlation between MPG (fuel efficiency) and Model Year. 
We are using a data set of 398 automobiles ranging from 1970-1982. 
This data set was analyzed using several methods such as Simple Linear Regression (1) and Multiple Linear Regression (2). 
The results of (1) indicated a slight positive correlation between the two, indicating that a higher MPG is slightly associated with a higher Model Year.
