## Abstract 
Abstract—The automobile industry is constantly evolving with technology, one of the most importance advancements is fuel efficiency. This is tied in with a combined effort to curb the use of fossil fuels and reduce the total amount of emissions. This study will examine the correlation between MPG (fuel efficiency) and Model Year. We are using a data set of over 33,000 automobiles including 9 features. It is important to note this data is not representative. This data set was analyzed using several methods such as Simple Linear Regression (1) and multiple Linear Regression (2). The results of (1) indicated a slight positive correlation between the two, indicating that a higher MPG is slightly associated with a higher Model Year. However, the R2 of this model is 1.7%, which indicated that out model only explains roughly 1.7% of the variation in our data. However with the introduction of a second independent variable, we were able to make a more robust model (2). This model was much more accurate giving us roughly a 799% increase in out R2 value. These results indicate that Model Year isn’t the strongest indicator for MPG. This means focusing on Model Year may not be sufficient for improvements in fuel efficiency however adding additional features can help us predict it.
